                    As a Technical Lead at ICANotes, I lead a team responsible for the billing component in a healthcare sector project. My role involves organizing quarters, sprints, and assignments, as well as analyzing the technical design for each feature to ensure optimal implementation. I provide continuous assistance and direction to team members, acting as a critical touchpoint between PMs, developers, and QAs.

                <p>
                    One notable challenge we faced involved a sudden need to switch clearinghouse providers mid-sprint. Leveraging our agile methodologies, we swiftly integrated with a new provider, ensuring project continuity without compromising our timeline. Additionally, I introduced a paradigm shift to decouple backend controllers based on GRASP principles, significantly improving system modularity. I also reconfigured our libraries to utilize Jest for unit testing effectively, enhancing our code reliability and maintainability.

                    At Tecla, I worked as a Full-Stack Developer on a project in the healthcare sector. My initial focus was on fixing numerous bugs, which significantly improved the application's quality and stability. This effort not only enhanced the user experience but also boosted customer satisfaction. Through my dedication and performance, I became an integral part of the billing sector team, where I contributed to the addition of new features that facilitated day-to-day operations for existing clients and attracted new clients.

                    At Perficient, I played a pivotal role in the front-end development of the Less-than-Truckload (LTL) project for XPO Logistics. This project focused on enhancing the shipping of small loads within cities. My initial tasks involved fixing bugs and gradually evolved into a more significant role where I contributed to story development and business design decisions. Over time, I became a crucial bridge between UX, PMs, and QA, ensuring seamless communication and integration of ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project aimed to replace a legacy system with a modern, efficient solution. The new system, leveraging advanced technologies, outperformed the old one in various aspects, including speed, route suggestions (enhanced by machine learning algorithms), reliability, real-time truck tracking, and Google Maps integration.

                    At Altimetrik, I contributed to significant projects for both Davinta Technologies and the Bank of New York, focusing on developing internal tools for banking operations. For Davinta Technologies, I worked on a product designed to manage various banking services such as loans, accounts, exchanges, and transfers. This application, intended for internal use by employees, featured dashboards and legal forms. Collaborating with a team based in India, I gained valuable experience in the banking sector and successfully navigated the challenges of cross-timezone teamwork. My contributions to this project led to a request from another client, which resulted in my involvement with the Bank of New York.

                    For the Bank of New York, I developed an internal tool that provided dashboards and metrics for different parts of the banking system.

                    At Geocom, I began as a manual QA but quickly transitioned into a software development role by spearheading the creation of a new QA Automation area. Recognizing the inefficiency of repetitive manual testing, I initiated the development of two internal automation tools using Python and Java. These tools were designed to automate testing for the company's main projects, including Point of Sales and Web Applications Managers.                   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over time, I expanded and maintained these tools to cover additional sectors within the company. I implemented significant improvements, such as running tests in parallel environments, orchestrating them with Docker containers, and enhancing stability to reduce false positives. Additionally, I acquired DevOps skills to run tests overnight in clean environments, which involved installing and deploying systems and their databases.

                <p>
                    My work greatly improved product quality by ensuring automated smoke testing of critical features. Development efficiency was enhanced as automation allowed for continuous testing, particularly after the addition of new features. I also trained other team members to use these tools, enabling them to create automated tests for their projects.
